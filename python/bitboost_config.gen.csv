name,default,type,description
train,"","String","Name of training dataset (cli only)."
test,"","String","Name of test dataset (cli only)."
objective,"L2","String","Name of the objective to use (l2, l1, huber, binary, hinge)."
metrics,[],"Vec<String>","Comma separated list of metrics to evaluate during training (l2, rmse, binary_loss,""binary_error)."
metric_frequency,1,"usize","The metrics are evaluated every `metric_frequency` iterations."
csv_has_header,True,"bool","Whether first line of CSV file is header (cli only)."
csv_delimiter,44,"u8","Delimiter in CSV data files (cli only)."
categorical_features,[],"Vec<usize>","Comma separated list of categorical feature indexes (starting at 0)."
niterations,100,"usize","Total number of trees constructed by the model."
learning_rate,1,"NumT","Learning rate / shrinkage: each tree's predictions is multiplied by this value."
reg_lambda,0,"NumT","L2 regularization parameter."
min_examples_leaf,1,"u32","Nodes with less than `min_examples_leaf` examples will not be split. "
min_gain,0.000001,"NumT","Splits need to improve the predictions by at least `min_gain` in order to be executed."
huber_alpha,0.95,"NumT","Parameter of Huber loss: bounds of Huber are `huber_alpha` quantiles of gradients."
max_nbins,16,"usize","Maximum number of bins used during the pre-processing step of numerical and""high-cardinality features. No more than `max_nbins` splits are considered for these kinds""of features."
discr_nbits,4,"usize","Number of bits used to discretize the gradients (1, 2, 4, 8)."
max_tree_depth,6,"usize","Maximum depth of trees."
compression_threshold,0.5,"NumT","Ratio of (number of zero instance set 32-bit blocks) / (total number of instance set 32-bit""blocks) is compared to `compression_threshold`. If this ratio exceeds""`compression_threshold`, then compression is applied."
binary_gradient_bound,1.25,"NumT","Parameter for binary loss. Theoretical bounds for binary log-loss are -2 and 2. More""aggressive settings seem to result in faster convergence."
random_seed,1,"u64","Random number generation seed (e.g. for bagging, feature sampling)."
feature_fraction,1,"NumT","Fraction of features used by each tree."
example_fraction,1,"NumT","Example fraction / bagging fraction. Fraction of examples used by each tree."
sample_freq,1,"usize","Frequency of re-sampling features/examples; features and examples are sampled every""`sample_freq` iterations. Feature pre-processing also runs at the same moments."
